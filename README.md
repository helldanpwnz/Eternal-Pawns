[h1]Eternal Pawns[/h1]

The main goal of the "Eternal Pawns" mod is to transform the endless stream of randomly generated NPCs into a logical, living population, where characters aren't deleted by the whim of RNG but live in the world until they die of old age—or by your hand. Instead of RimWorld creating a new "Raider #452" and forgetting them forever after the battle, the mod saves surviving characters and brings them back to you again over time, simulating their life and development in the background.

[h2]Veteran System (Saving and Summoning)[/h2]

[b]Saving:[/b] Living NPCs who leave the map enter the veteran pool. The mod heals their temporary wounds (but leaves scars) and protects them from being deleted by the game ([i]KeepForever[/i]).

[b]Smart Summon:[/b] Instead of generating new pawns, the game substitutes suitable veterans from the same faction. The check accounts for race, xenotype (Biotech), mutations (Anomaly), and traits. You can choose the percentage chance of meeting veterans in faction encounters. Even with a small limit of 50 or 100 per faction and, say, a 30% veteran rate, the world will feel diverse, yet familiar faces will always be there to greet (or threaten) you. Everything else is generated by the game as usual.

[b]Cooldown:[/b] After a mission, a veteran "rests" (configurable) before appearing in the world again.

[h2]Life in the World (Annual Report)[/h2]

Once a year, events are calculated for veterans off-map:

[b]Aging and Death:[/b] Pawns aged 60+ can die. The chance depends on the faction's tech level (higher for primitives). (Configurable in settings)

[b]Development:[/b] Veterans learn skills and develop age-related diseases. (Configurable in settings)

[b]Upgrades:[/b] Factions heal their heroes. Depending on the tech level, they may receive prosthetics (from wooden parts to bionics), genes (Biotech) for spacers/ultratech, or Void mutations (Anomaly) for neolithic and medieval factions. (Configurable in settings)

[h2]Interface[/h2]

[b]"Memory" Button:[/b] Located in the "Social" tab, it allows you to manually "pin" any NPC (ignoring pool limits) and write a personal note (e.g., "This jerk killed my favorite colonist"). The note will be saved and available during your next encounter. This button can be disabled if you prefer a purely natural progression of the world and character stories.

[b]Indication:[/b] The button color immediately shows the status: blue means they are already a veteran, yellow means they were manually marked by you.

[h2]Optimization and Compatibility[/h2]

[b]Freezing:[/b] In the vanilla game, if a pawn has a disease or any condition that progresses (like an addiction), it constantly "ticks" in the background. My mod implements a system where permanent dependencies (like Hussars with Go-juice) are frozen immediately. All others (infections, pregnancy, etc.) are frozen by default after 30 days (configurable). This ensures no negative impact on performance.

[b]Compatibility:[/b] Designed to be compatible with everything. It uses standard RimWorld methods for pawn compatibility checks. Full support for [b]Biotech, Anomaly, and HAR[/b]. Patches have high priority—the mod will substitute a veteran before other mods start generating a new pawn.

[b]Summary:[/b] The world becomes alive. Enemies gain history, scars, and bionics after meeting you, turning from "extras" into individuals.
